- Hello! I'm St4rshine! :3
-  I love programming, hardware development, space/spacecraft!
- I’m currently learning c++ development.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on the Linux kernel and Godot engine, as well as make my own repositories and projects.
-  How to reach me: neutronst4rshine@proton.me!
- Pronouns: She/they <3
- Fun fact! Did you know that Mixtral 8x7b has an uncensored variant? It's on huggingface, look it up!~
- Speaking of AI, I will not use AI for programming. I use it for simple information, but in my opinion it is detracting from human creativity. I may work on models, heck, even ones that program! But you won't catch me using it for my own code. Also I like programming and would rather not have a machine do it for me.
- Help support my work!~ [https://buymeacoffee.com/st4rshine](My buy me a coffee)
